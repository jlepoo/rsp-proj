          <h2>Aspiring techie/developer, based in Sydney AU</h2>
          <p>
            I'm currently an SEO & content coordinator looking to expand my
            skillset and develop in the technical space. My current journey has
            involved learning HTML, CSS, Javascript and responsive web design.

            This was my first project and involved a single web page. I chose to
            design a page that allowed users to choose a vegan meal plan. The
            text on page changed via javascript depending on the users
            selection. This was a fun project though I wish I had spent more
            time planning and focusing on design.

            This was my second project and involved providing a real weather
            forecast using API. Though I am mostly happy with the design, this
            project challenged me. I wish I had more time to fully study and
            understand API calls and javascript but with a full time job, it was
            challenging to study this as much as I would have liked.
